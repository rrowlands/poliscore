The Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017 aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 ozone standards set by the Clean Air Act. This delay may benefit certain economic sectors by reducing immediate regulatory compliance costs and providing additional time for businesses to adapt, which is why it is slightly positive for the economy and commerce sector.

However, by postponing the enforcement of stricter ozone standards, there could be negative repercussions for public health, particularly respiratory health issues, as higher ozone levels are linked to various ailments. This justifies the negative impact on healthcare. Social Equity suffers as disadvantaged communities often bear the brunt of poor air quality.

Furthermore, the delay negatively affects environmental management, wildlife, and natural resource conservation efforts, as high ozone levels harm ecosystems and contribute to climate change.

In summary, while the bill may provide short-term economic relief and slightly more efficient state implementation timelines, the overall long-term impacts on public health and the environment are considerably negative.
