        <p>The data on this page was generated using OpenAI's GPT-4o. Studies have shown GPT-4 to have a left-wing political bias. Additionally, LLMs work by parroting back training data and do not necessarily root all opinions in concrete morals or logically consistent world views. Please consider this information as part of an experimental AI analysis rather than definitive or authoritative guidance.
